## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a motivated and hands-on Cybersecurity and Cloud Engineer with a strong foundation in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and network defense.  
I hold the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP), Certified Offensive Security Junior (COSJ), and Practical Junior Penetration Tester (PJPT) certifications.

I have practical experience simulating real-world attacks on Active Directory, web applications, and cloud environments through platforms such as Hack The Box and AWS Labs.

I am passionate about bridging the gap between Offensive Security and Cloud Infrastructure Security, and I am eager to contribute to a forward-thinking IT Security or Cloud Engineering team through a junior role, internship, or hands-on training opportunity.
