#  Hi, I'm Mohamed Galole

 Cybersecurity & Cloud Engineer | AWS Certified

---

I'm a Cloud and Cybersecurity Engineer with hands-on experience designing secure, scalable AWS architectures and performing offensive security testing in enterprise-like environments.

I hold the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate, AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, and Practical Junior Penetration Tester certifications, validating both my cloud architecture knowledge and practical security skills.

My experience includes:

Designing decoupled and event-driven AWS architectures (SNS, SQS, Lambda, IAM, VPC)

Implementing secure networking (public/private subnets, security groups, least privilege IAM)

Simulating real-world attacks against Active Directory and web applications

Performing vulnerability analysis and post-exploitation in controlled lab environments

I am particularly interested in Cloud Security, Infrastructure as Code, and building resilient, production-ready systems that align with security best practices.
